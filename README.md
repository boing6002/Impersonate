### Details

- allows a user to impersonate another user, by using a middleware
- permits testing and debugging from the perspective of another user, without needing his credentials
- comes with its own controller, routes and blade components that permit starting and stopping the impersonation process
- depends on [Permission Manager](https://github.com/laravel-enso/PermissionManager) in order to be able to verify permissions

### Notes
